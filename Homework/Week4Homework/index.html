  <p>Here is a paragragh used as a place holder for another paragraph that will actually take the place of this. Any information provided here is almost completely unnessesary. This may not even be a full paragraph, it will be filled with typ-O's, non sequiturs, and lazy writing. Once upon a time a student signed up for a bootcamp, and by week 3 realized why it was referred to as a bootcamp. If you have made it this far through this paragraph, we thank you for time. </p>
